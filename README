        WatchService: monitor file tree only supported in Windows[1]
    see for architechture:https://fascinator.usq.edu.au/trac/wiki/Watcher 
watcher
    stand-alone
    daemon

listen to fs event
    if missed,
        rescan watched dir
        compare with previous state

    put event into a queue/FIFO
        let subscriber process the event one by one
        parallel processing?
    filter event
        create new file => CREATE and THEN MODIFY => CREATE
        other cases

depositor
    one of the subscriber
    got notified
        get message
            contains: (fullpath, event.kind, dateTime?,size?)
        if message.size <= SIZE.MAXSIZE
            read file
            store temporary
            encrypt it
            compress it
            AND THEN
                create metadata encryption[2] use, compression used, md5
                forward using streaming to target/backend
